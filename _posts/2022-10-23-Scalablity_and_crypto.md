## Scalability and Crypto

There are a myriad number of narratives fussiladated in the distribution services of pretty much every media service. A lot of commotion in ideas and possibilities this new dimension of technology ,and what it can bring to us. Blockchain is as powerful as Internet! a spectacular force that when given some velocity will change the course of how systems works around the world, with its momentum. It started with Bitcoin and led to some 2k and counting more coins, often launched into the system sphere by ICO (initial coin offering). With the second most famous being Ethereum, this coin is backed by a Blockchain technology that supports smart contracts, the most famous of them being NFT(non fungible token).

What makes crypto the technology of future? Like any other asset there is a lot of speculation around this one. To answer this question we can go back in time where the 'barter system' exists and people live in small communities, they exchange goods and live in the vicinity of their environs. But the wildest thing one could do is explore.  In the middle of times, Ring roads were found, people noticed that certain product of a region is remarkably better than, that in their environs, in order to import things scale them the dynasties had currencies that made goods and services scalable.  Now crypto aims to break the barrier of scaling even more further with finishing the barriers of banks.  Start-ups like InstaDapp that aims to be the wallet for all the tokens existing, or the crypto exchange platform FTX. Blockchain backed data storage for the real estate data. The utilities are impactful ,and promising for a better future- where barriers are even more less.
