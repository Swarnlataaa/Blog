## Decentralised Storage System Maybe The Next Big Rally

What is a Decentralised Storage System?
Let us first break the terms into two parts- Decentralised and Storage.
Decentralisation, as we many of us know, is the distribution of power among all the parties and not just let it concentrate in the hands of the central authority. Decentralisation is seen in politics wherein authority is given to states as well instead of just being given to the central government. In terms of cryptocurrencies, there are decentralised exchanges (DEX) that are direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions taking place online in a secure manner. Such transactions do not need any kind of intermediary or a central party.
Storage, again a very basic term used by us whenever looking at a smartphone, laptop or hard-disks. It is simply the retention of big or small chunks of information that can be conveniently retrieved later on.
When we combine these two terms, we get Decentralised Storage.

Why can it be the Next Big Rally?
The question- “Why Decentralised Storage?”- still remains. To answer this, there are several big benefits of using this concept. Plus points like freedom of information, reduced storage costs, optimised transmission speed and many more. But the driving factor here is the grave matter of privacy. Whenever we store any type of information, the most crucial part is keeping it secure and private. Since decentralised (being the key word) storage has no central part/ intermediary, it provides for a safer and more privacy oriented system. Every now and then ,we hear cases of data breach involving even the biggest and most successful networks the world has to offer. The infamous Facebook-Cambridge Analytica Case for instance had approximately 87 million users affected by the breach. To avoid such big scandals, decentralised storage is an impeccable option. It can prove to be the solution to all such issues and that is why Blockchain firms are researching deeply upon it.

FileCoin (IPFS) and Sia
FileCoin and Sia are the leading decentralised storage networks.
The prototype used to do this is something called IPFS, that is Inter-Planetary File System. Unlike our regular URL that uses location servers as addresses, IPFS uses the very content of the data files. FileCoin, like other decentralised storage systems, introduces a whole new economy and way of thinking about incentives and participation via networking. In exchange for FileCoins, individuals are effectively rewarded for serving and hosting content on their harddrives. It also has the potential to be used in conjunction with other Blockchain networks as a decentralised off-chain storage solution, which would be fascinating to witness.
Sia is another young project. Its goal is to take advantage of underutilised hard drive capacity all across the world to build a data storage marketplace that is more efficient and less expensive than present options. They have a working product with unique design elements.
Their Proof of Storage technique is used on the network to further protect and validate proofs and file contracts.

Because the technology is still relatively new, it may take some time before it is widely adopted and mainstreamed. As we've seen, engineers are still working on addressing the obvious flaws. The benefits of decentralised blockchain-based storage, on the other hand, already outweigh those of centralised storage systems — and this technology is only anticipated to improve in the near future.

The purpose of this article is essentially to educate new readers to gain knowledge about never-heard-before-concept like Decentralised Storage and how can be fruitful.Secondary propose is to research upon the given topic, weigh out the pros and cons and then proceed to form an educated opinion about the same.
Yes, this article can give knowledge to the readers as it has all the basic, beginner level information provided in one place.
I feel I can do better if I’m allowed to delve deeper into detail about the topic. However, as a beginner myself, I have done a fair job.
Yes, as per my understanding I do answer the commonly asked questions for a noob through this article.
